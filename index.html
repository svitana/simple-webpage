    <h1>Home alone</h1>
    <p><b>Home Alone is a 1990 American Christmas comedy film written and produced by John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus. The film stars Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister, a boy who is mistakenly left behind when his family flies to Paris for their Christmas vacation. Kevin initially relishes being home alone, but soon has to contend with two would-be burglars played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The film also features Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as Kevin's parents.

Culkin was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor â€“ Musical or Comedy. After its release, Home Alone became the highest-grossing live action comedy film of all time in the United States, and also held the record worldwide until it was overtaken by The Hangover Part II in 2011. It is the highest grossing Christmas movie of all time at the North American box office (when adjusted for inflation).[3][4] Home Alone has spawned a successful film franchise with four sequels, including the 1992 film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, the only Home Alone sequel to have the original cast reprising their roles.</b></p>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>What will happen if you leave a child <strong> one at home </strong>? Oh, here everything is already decided by the circumstances, but there will not be any peace in this house. And if you leave <em> Kevin McCalister </em> in a chic two-story building,
        you just have to see it. Not by years and the growth is sophisticated and smart, this cute kid can not only cook himself, wash things and go to the store, but also give a tough repulsion to two thieves who have got into trouble for the good in
        the house of Kevin. Such is he, the character of the movie "One at Home". Not wanting to put up with what's happening reality, baby Kevin takes the situation into their own hands. Such are the words "small and foolish", and now to two adult thugs
        who called themselves "wet gangsters" (not at all for "wet", but for the characteristic, so-called "trace", which they left behind) - in general they will have to pay their own health, because they underestimated the little owner of the McCallisters
        house ... It would be better if they had to climb at the first signs of desperate resistance from the side of the baby <small> (many people thought about it when watching the movie) </small > but no, perseverance and the desire to catch "slander" push two idiots into new ones yprobuvannya its stability.</p>

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When Makoley Kalkin comes to the church, the well-known Ukrainian song Shchedryk sounds in English, known in the West as Carol of the Bells, the "Christmas carols", the most popular Christmas song in North America.</li>
        <li>The film "At Home" fell into the Guinness Book of Records as a comedy that collected more of the money in the box office. About $ 533,000,000</li>
        <li>Joe Peschy (thief) worked on a film based on the Stanislavsky system. He wanted Makoley Kalkin (Kevin) to be really afraid of him, so he avoided the boy on the shooting site.</li>
        <li>In real life, childhood jokes from the movie "At Home" could have led to death. For example, in a scene with a soldering lamp, the scalp would be damaged so much that it would take an operation and implant.</li>
        <li>Interestingly, the fifth part was supposed to be a mystical thriller with elements of comedy. The working title of the film was "One at Home: One in the Dark." But from this idea the creators subsequently refused, because such a story was not suitable for family viewing.</li>
